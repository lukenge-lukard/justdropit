        <h1 style="text-align: center;">WE ALL BELIEVE IN SOMETHING BIGGER THAN US</h1>

        <hr style="width: 100%; border: 10px solid #051e58;">

                <p>
                    Yes, we all do believe in something: something bigger than us, something greater. Our entire being
                    revolves around the belief in something out there that is of greater power than we are. Humanity is
                    in believing and trusting in a higher power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is evident in the different religions there is in the world. Everyone believes in some kind of
                    power. The religions believe in God for example. Different names are given to God in the different
                    religions. People who believe in these religions train their children from their young age to
                    believe in the same Supreme Being.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These children’s minds just cannot fit anything together if the character of this Being is taken out
                    of the picture. Nothing else can make sense. The moment you take away what people believe in at the
                    core of their hearts, their lives lose meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would be just another species of animals born to a male and a female. I doubt we would remain
                    with this dominance over the other species as we do for now. We would be just another cat, dog or
                    cow taking residence on this earth for a few months or so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What we believe in, whether in a supreme being or ourselves as a species, makes us human. Believing
                    that there is something bigger than us draws a line for us. It makes us settle for what society
                    believes to be our limit. It creates order in our communities. It keeps us together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the most part, the Supreme Being in many of the religions on earth is taken to have complete
                    power over anything. Take for instance God in Christianity. He is all powerful, all knowing and
                    omnipresent. He is the beginning and the end (the alpha and omega).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This simplifies many things in a human life. We are curious beings and therefore even in our infant
                    years we have a pile of questions about the idea of life. Questions like: where did we come from?
                    What is this thing inside my body that produces sound? How am I able to drive my body to all the
                    directions it goes? Who am I really? Why am I confined in this body? Is there something greater than
                    I am?
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p>
                    These are the very questions we ask ourselves everyday mostly in our subconscious minds. These are
                    the very questions that push us to instinctively move out every day from our comfort zones and
                    search for answers. They question our past, present and future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where did I come from? Where am I today? Where am I going? These are the core materials of success.
                    You must know where you are and how you got there; where you came from to reach where you are. And
                    finally you must have a picture of where you are heading – a goal, a vision of sorts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And believing in a Supreme Being helps us answer one of these core questions very easily – where did
                    we come from? Believing that we were created by God solves a lot of mystery in this world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether it is true or not, just believing in something greater than us gives us a little peace of
                    mind. It frees us of some responsibilities. It fills in as an answer to would-be nagging questions
                    in our lives. It gives us focus. Our energy is directed to a path and therefore can be useful. It is
                    no longer just wandering about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What is your purpose in life? Yes, tell me dear friend. How would you answer that question if you
                    didn’t believe in something greater than just you? There is no way you can tell your purpose in life
                    unless you base it on some belief.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your life serves its purpose based on some narrative, on something people believe in. The society
                    you are born into or you grow from believes in something and it’s from that that you will find your
                    purpose in life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What do you believe in?
