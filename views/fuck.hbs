        <hr style="width: 100%; border: 10px solid #051e58;">

        <div class="row padding">
            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-6">

                <p>
                    Some of us are not infected! Yes, but we sure as hell are affected! And you know what? Fuck y’all!
                    Yes, fuck all the stakeholders. All those that have a say in changing the situation we have been
                    forced into. Yeah, I am heading for you guys because guess what; the situation hasn’t changed yet.
                    So, fuck y’all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don’t give a fuck at this point in time. You can do whatever the hell you wish to me. At this
                    point, I have suffered it all. There isn’t a thing you can do to me now that can surmount the pain I
                    have got from this experience. I have had it all. And I fucking hate it so hard.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You should all just go fuck yourselves. Yeah, at first, it made sense. It seemed like you were
                    actually doing all this shit for us – for our own good! I was good with that part. Home with smiles;
                    considered it a holiday of sorts, even tried venturing into new skills. I tried the cooking; my
                    fingers suffered a few times, eyes watered from onions, I tried the reading.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reading! Yeah, with the time and the orders to stay home whole day every day, it seemed like if a
                    fucked up guy like I was settled and determined to do so, they would actually read and complete
                    their entire syllabus. Yeah, it seemed! But that is exactly what didn’t happen. Syllabus my ass!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, not at first! At first, I did read – for about a week and a half. Then the morale began dying.
                    And I take full responsibility for all of it. I definitely wouldn’t blame my loss of morale on any
                    of you – the stake holders. It wasn’t your fault. You’re very innocent; you pretty little angels,
                    you are the most perfect of all living beings. But fuck you nonetheless!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know myself. I am a good student. At least I try. And I know my friends. They are good too. I have
                    seen them; lived with them, chuckled with them, I am their friend. We are friends. Yes, we may be a
                    little stubborn but you know what? We always got the grades. But you pretty little angels, what have
                    you done? Yes, tell me. As a matter of fact, tell us. What the fuck have you done? Show us!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You have fucking done no shit! And deep down, you also see it; you are messing more things up and
                    you fucking know it. If I was any crazy, I would say you’re actually enjoying this. Which I am
                    anyway! You’re gaining from all of this, aren’t you? Isn’t that one of the reasons you want this to
                    continue?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, at the surface you might say you have done no wrong. That you are only helping the nation, the
                    world, the young generation; that you are saving us – our lives! And you know what? Up to some
                    level, I am totally on your side. I do believe that – up to some level – you are saving some of us.
                    Thank you so much. We are grateful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But please don’t let my show fool you. Don’t! There are things you’ve fucked up. And you know it.
                    That’s my entire point anyway – you know what I am talking about! Let’s not even go so far as to
                    look for examples. Just take a look at me. Yeah, take a good look at me. This is your
                    accomplishment. I hope you are fucking proud of your results. I was never this angry piece of shit.
                    Not at all! These are your results. When you left me with me, what did you expect would happen, huh?
                    What did you expect? You know what; don’t even make a sound, I don’t wanna hear it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You fucked up; and you know it. This is all your fault. You designed “the” system. You didn’t
                    consult me. Well, who am I kidding; my vote didn’t count, did it? How would it anyway? I was only a
                    child, a fetus, not yet born. Only to be squeezed into your pretty little system the moment I lay
                    foot on this world. Foot! Well, the head came first but who am I kidding, it’s all fucking the same.
                    The moment I landed here, you put me straight into your system. I don’t remember signing up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No, I didn’t. Don’t even fucking look at my parents. Don’t! Unless you want me to fuck you up! Leave
                    my parents out of this. This is all you! Yes, it’s all you and your system. The system produced what
                    it desired; then it fucking bribed them with false hopes of a bright future for their kids – just
                    like it has always done years and years before. So what did my parents do? As a matter of fact, your
                    system didn’t even leave so much as another option. I definitely had to be incorporated into your
                    prestigious sweet little system. And I was.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, it has its good days, you know; the experience hasn’t been that bad. I am not here to complain
                    about the way it has treated me. No, I have had a good life; a very good childhood, not mistreated
                    at all. Not even one single bit in my entire stay in the system. They were all termed as lessons.
                    Yeah, punishments to straighten my ass! And am not bitching about any of that either. No, I am what
                    I am because of your system and I am fucking proud of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The results aren’t so bad. I was stubborn, rebellious and a trouble causer; but you occupied me. If
                    not with punishments, you gave me assignments and when I performed; well, what did you do? You
                    rewarded me. See? Like I said, it wasn’t so bad. It felt good. It always feels good to be rewarded.
                    As a matter of fact, even to be punished – it all feels good. Yeah, I felt like I was being
                    recognized. That is a very good feeling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wasn’t just another cog in the system. You made me feel like I was an individual. A reason as to
                    why I can say all this anyway. I am an individual. When you punished me, I felt like you saw me as
                    one and punished me for me. And presumably or as I would love to think, you placed me back in line
                    with the others – the other “ones” that you had also punished back into line or something like that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The system had its good days. And I appreciate them. You see it’s actually the very reason I say my
                    friends and I are good students. We are learned. Your system has taught us so much and I for one, am
                    grateful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But once again, don’t let my all show fool you. You pretty little angels! You who designed this
                    system! Just in case you missed that, I said “you who designed this system!” Yeah, you took all the
                    time and came up with a system. You obviously couldn’t waste all that time and energy and not profit
                    from it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You fuckers designed this system to contain us. From the very early years, we are enrolled; taught
                    into the system and we fucking have to work in it at the end of all your fucking alleged “lessons”.
                    I am actually pretty cool with all of that, just so you know! I am happy you give us jobs. I gladly
                    sit down in those lectures and give in my whole to secure those sweet little jobs. We all do. And
                    that’s exactly my point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are balls deep into the system. It has fucked us up so badly and we have fucking accepted it; in
                    sight of hope that we might get a bright future and stop this fucking. We accepted. Yeah we did!
                    Just keep fucking us; as long as we get our payment at the very end. We don’t mind. We even know the
                    end. You’re pretty very generous with the information about the length of your fucking for sure! We
                    actually always looked at it, visualized it per say, as you kept fucking us up.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p>
                    And then you stopped. Yeah, you fucking stopped. It was a relief at first but not anymore. You know
                    why? It is because you fucking didn’t pay us. Well, logically it wasn’t the end. So you were pretty
                    justified to pull out and not compensate us when you did. With the disguise of letting us slide back
                    to our families and keep safe! Fucking giving us posho in the mean time!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You know what? Fuck you! How about that? Just come back and fuck us and be done with it. Don’t rest;
                    not now, not yet. We haven’t got our payments yet. Come on, let us all go back to our fuck joints
                    and continue the action. And when we get our payments, you can surely rest as much as you want.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy the holidays. I do; just as much as the next man. They are my resting
                    periods from all of your fucking. It’s where I get the energy, to rejuvenate and come back for
                    another round of your action. Knowing the number of times left for your action, I don’t desire long
                    holidays. I just want all of this to be done and get my payments. The whore years are over. I have
                    done all you have wanted of me. Now, I desire to be something of my own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So can you please fucking let all the action commence right back! And let us be done with all of it.
                    If you actually think we are having fun with all of this, you are wrong. And don’t get me wrong, we
                    could have fun. Yes, we could. If you actually let it be a normal holiday. Yeah, we can enjoy
                    ourselves. Don’t let my bitching make you think we love you that much. No my friend, don’t even
                    flatter yourself. You are only a means to an end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To show you what am talking about; you open all the other sectors up. Let the bars, pubs and all the
                    other “joints” jump right back into business as usual. We shall definitely drink ourselves up. Let
                    our parents all go back to their jobs. And you will see how much we love you. We won’t even think
                    about you at all. We shall just go help out with our old men – the parents. Transport open,
                    businesses open and entertainment joints all open; you can keep your fucking to yourself!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This shit of staying home whole day every day is what I am all against. I know my noise may not mean
                    a thing at all. But I hold faith in the fact that I am not the only one with the same cry. And when
                    our cries join, I am sure as hell our roar will scare the hell out of you. Let this message roam
                    around. Let it move from ear to ear, eye to eye till the concerned pretty little angels get a peek
                    at it. Because this is theirs!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want them to know, what they already know anyway, but explicitly that it is a whole lot far from
                    pleasurable when you are left with yourself. Do you know how fucked the thoughts I have very early
                    in the morning when I have just woken up are? Do you?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, at first I was a good little boy. Woke up, did the chores and the day moved on. Almost all the
                    time was free time. So as a good little boy, I made a very good decision to use this alleged “free
                    time” to learn a number of new things. I am now a pretty little chef myself – all thanks to you I
                    guess. I have broken and repaired many of the ties with my relatives, siblings and parents. Well,
                    obviously because I talk to them on a daily basis, or at least I used to. But that all sucks now!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don’t know. Maybe I am just fucked up myself. But I got to tell you, something doesn’t smell
                    right. No, let me ask you! You see; after you’re done working, you rest, right? You rest for all the
                    good there is to resting; majorly so that you’re back into a working shape. So now, how do you rest
                    from resting, huh? How do you do that? Do you sleep from napping?
                </p>
                <p>
                    You see, from being a chef, I tried the trending exercising back then. I kept in shape. My room even
                    changed appearance. I organized it to accommodate a work-out spot. Everything was all well laid out.
                    In the morning and in the evening, if I wasn’t reading, cooking, I was working out. My body was all
                    getting in shape. The abs! Jesus, the abs! They finally came out so sharply that I was so proud of
                    the “holiday” and the “free time”. But it was all useless! I kept working out but never went for
                    sports, in fear of the so called situation in the country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I never went out for drinks with my buddies. Well, that shit wasn’t legal yet so I pretty much went
                    out with myself. Jesus! All the evil thoughts that would swirl in my mind! I think on some of those
                    days, Einstein would take my head for a spin. I had to me what felt like some cool scientific
                    revelations. I went deep. My mind was never in one place; it was all over the world – thinking this
                    and everything else.
                </p>

                    It was no longer hinged to anything. I had fully fledged discussions with myself on topics like:
                    politics, sports, movies, songs, sex, jobs; well you got me! It was mostly one thing. The most basic
                    of human nature! It always found its way back into the drive whenever I tried thinking some
                    important shit about things like my future. I actually one day almost got the cure to this disease.
                    But that one thing came back and took my about-to-be-invented formula away.

                    So if you got anything from my bitching today, it is this: there’s going to be a whole lot of
                    psychological problems to deal with during and after all this period. Don’t be surprised to watch
                    weird news of guys doing stupid shit. Don’t! People walking naked, eating grass, fucking raping
                    extremely out of their age range, slapping their mums; am telling you, you’re going to hear all that
                    stupid shit. Well, obviously all that because people have been deprived of their usual contact with
                    their crew.

                    People are different. That’s ideally what makes us who we are – the uniqueness. Humans are all
                    different. Some are introverts and others extroverts. Some are into sports and some of us are into
                    other screen businesses. But we get along just fine. We are happy with our circles, the friends and
                    the environment in them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of us are cool with having a few close friends while others; well, they are into stadiums of
                    friends. And it’s all cool. That is their life. That is how they live it; whether they enjoy it or
                    not, that is for them to decide. We handle our lives differently and we are all cool with it, at
                    least for the most part. So if you round up everyone and just resort them to the same measure of
                    living, I got to tell you; that shit isn’t cool.

                    It would be cool – you know – if it was all professional, like it was at the very beginning. But it
                    no longer is. So come on, let’s stop pretending it still is and let people move on with their lives.
                    These people aren’t blind – they see what’s going on. Let alone that whole show you put up on the
                    media. No, those that have began travelling, they see it. And you know it! You know what; fuck it,
                    am out of this place. Just realized, you already know the lyrics to this song. So I am done singing,
                    I’ll be back with something better. We all will. Till then, enjoy yourselves.
